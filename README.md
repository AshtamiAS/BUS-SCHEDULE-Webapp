Bus Schedule Management System
This project is a Bus Schedule Management System designed to manage and display bus schedules based on user inputs regarding bus details such as source, destination, type, and time range. The system allows users to input bus details and then filter the generated information based on specific criteria.

Features
Input Bus Details: Users can input bus details including source, destination, type (e.g., SUPERFAST, CITYFAST, INTERSTATE), and time range.

Filtering: The system filters the generated bus schedule information based on the user's specified criteria.

Display: Filtered bus schedules are displayed for the user, providing information such as bus type, source, destination, departure time, and arrival time.
Usage
Input Bus Details:
Run the program and input the bus details when prompted.


Enter the source, destination, type of bus, and time range (if applicable).

Filtering:
After inputting the bus details, the system filters the generated information based on the specified criteria.

Display:
Filtered bus schedules are displayed for the user, showing relevant information such as bus type, source, destination, departure time, and arrival time.

Example
Suppose the user wants to find bus schedules from "Kazhakootam" to "Kollam" between 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM. The user inputs the following details:

Source: Kazhakootam
Destination: Kollam
Time Range: 8:00 AM - 11:00 AM
The system filters the bus schedules accordingly and displays the relevant information for buses matching the specified criteria.
